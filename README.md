# Products API with Express, TypeScript, and Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL) using Vector Search
In this guide, we will build a Products API using Express and TypeScript, and integrate Azure Cosmos DB (with vector search capabilities) for managing product data. We'll also implement vector search, enabling us to query items based on vector similarity.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- An Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account
- Register for Azure Cosmos DB Vector Search `preview` as described in your input
